# deep-learning [WIP]

An exploration of the entire history of deep learning from DNNs to GPT-4o through the lens of the constraints limiting progress.

In the repository, I've included a copy of each critical paper, along with my full explanation of high-level intuitions, mathematical intuitions, code implementation, and broader impact.

On the rest of this page, I provide an overview of everything we can learn from this history, inspired by [_The Lessons of History_](https://www.amazon.com/Lessons-History-Will-Durant/dp/143914995X) by Will & Ariel Durant.

**The project is designed so everyone can get most of the value by reading the overview below.**

Then, people curious to dive into the technical details can explore the rest of the repository. The table at the bottom of this page provides an index for all the topics & papers covered.
